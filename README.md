### Closed Beta MVP Access

User registration is currently unavailable to the public but the web-app is fully functional and live, accessible via email invitation.

If you've found this repository, it is more than likely you've also received an email invitation with your unique guest user credentials. Please go ahead and login to the application with the provided guest account username + password and try out some of the awesome features that [Slay.Style](https://slay.style) has to offer!

If you need guest account credentials to try it out, please shoot me an email over at jasonmxdev@gmail.com

### Getting Started

Once you've logged in, simply head over to the `Wardrobe` page and then select `Reset Wardrobe` if you are on a desktop device or simply tap the `Reset Wardrobe` button which will be located on the homepage if you are on a smartphone. Doing so will replenish your current wardrobe with a set of sample apparels that will enable you to create different outfit styles (since apparel uploads have been temporarily disabled for security purposes).

Guest users have 2 instances of `Reset Wardrobe`s per day in case of accidental apparel deletions that can occur at times.
Apparel `uploads` are currently disabled for guest accounts but will be available again once data sanitization is fully implemented.

*Please note that the default app limitations for guest users may be subject to change with or without notice as there may be ongoing updates behind the scenes regarding the app's deployment infrastructures.
